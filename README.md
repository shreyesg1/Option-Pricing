This project is a simple Black-Scholes based option pricer for European stocks. 
A brief overview of the features:

Stock Information- For those who seek to make puts and/or calls based upon a given 
stock's current price and volatility, simply enter the stocks Ticker (eg. AAPL) and
the information will be displayed

Strike Price, Time to Maturity, Risk-Free Rate- The primary factors used in the 
Black-Scholes equation, subject to the user's discretion

Volatility and Spot Price Sliders- Allows the user to visualize the change in option
price with a change in each of these factors accompanied by a heatmap of prices

Display Values- Allows the user to see the exact numerical price for each grid spot
in the heatmap

Grid Size: Gives the user the ability to change how in-depth the heatmap is and how
many possible outcomes are displayed

To run, simply fill in the Strike Price, Time to Maturity, and Risk-Free Rate and a
heatmap will be automatically generated
